# Datathon organized by Understood.org

This repository contains the code and data for the work submitted at the datathon organized by Understood.org

- My team and I designed and built a recommendation engine for articles based on previous history, interests and/or similarity with respect to other users
- This 8-hour hackathon was organized by NYU Center for Data Science and the data was sponsored by Understood.org
- We used cosine similarity to find the closest article to the latest article read by a user. If the user had no read articles, then the most popular article is recommended to them. 
- At the end of the day, we presented our work and submitted our code for grading and evaluation

My team secured First place at the Datathon
